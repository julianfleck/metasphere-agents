"""Reliable tmux paste+submit for claude TUI sessions.

Bypasses bracketed-paste entirely by using ``tmux send-keys -l`` (literal
mode) to type the message character-by-character. Newlines within the
message are sent as ``C-j`` (newline-in-buffer, does not submit); final
submit is a single ``Enter``.

Belt-and-suspenders: after submitting, captures the pane and checks for
a stuck ``[Pasted text #`` placeholder. If found, retries Enter up to
3 times.

Confirmed-submit: the single submit ``C-m`` can be *eaten* when it fires
while Claude Code's Ink/React TUI is still settling the bracketed-paste
``\\e[201~`` end-marker — the paste content then lands **inline** in the
input box with NO ``[Pasted text #`` placeholder. The gateway watchdog
only force-submits *marker-prefixed* payloads (``[wake]``/``[task]``/…),
so an unmarked **human** message stranded this way is never recovered
(this is why operator-authored Telegram-relayed messages stick). The
post-submit poll below re-fires ``C-m`` when byte-stable inline content
proves the submit was eaten — reliable submission at the source, no
marker needed.

Never raises — returns False on failure.
