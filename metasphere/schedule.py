"""Cron-style job scheduler.

Uses the on-disk schema in ``$METASPHERE_DIR/schedule/jobs.json``.

* **No ``eval``.** Dispatch never shells out to a string; the only
  dispatch path is :func:`dispatch_to_agent`, which uses ``subprocess.run``
  with an explicit argv.
* **File locking on every read-modify-write.** ``load_jobs`` /
  ``save_jobs`` go through :func:`metasphere.io.file_lock` +
  :func:`metasphere.io.write_json` (atomic tmp+rename + flock).
* **Shrink-detection guard.** ``save_jobs`` refuses to write zero jobs
  when the input had jobs — protects against the subshell-pipe wipe bug
  that previously truncated ``jobs.json`` to ``[]``.
* **180s fire window.** Protects against tick drift, restarts,
  briefly-paused daemons.
