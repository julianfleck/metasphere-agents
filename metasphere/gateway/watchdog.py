"""Stuck-prompt recovery for the orchestrator session.

Five failure modes handled:

1. **Stuck pasted-text placeholder.** Bracketed-paste race occasionally
   leaves ``[Pasted text #N +M lines]`` in the pane with the Enter
   eaten. After 15s of the placeholder lingering we force an Enter.
1b. **Stuck inline inject.** The same bracketed-paste race on a *short*
   payload lands the content inline in the input box with NO
   ``[Pasted text #`` placeholder (the submit ``C-m`` fired before the
   paste landed, so the empty box submitted as a no-op and the text
   arrived just after). ``check_stuck_paste`` can't see it, and because
   auto-wakes ``defer_if_busy`` on the leftover typing signal, every
   subsequent wake logs ``[submit failed]`` and the pane stays stranded.
   When byte-stable content prefixed with a known harness marker
   (``[wake]``/``[task]``/…) has lingered past the threshold we force a
   submit — safe because a human never types those markers.
2. **Safety-hooks confirmation prompt.** Plugins occasionally prompt
   ``Do you want to proceed?`` with a numbered ``1. Yes`` option. We
   auto-send ``1`` + Enter, rate-limited to once every 10s so we never
   spam.
3. **Context limit reached.** When Claude's context window fills up,
   the TUI shows ``Context limit reached · /compact or /clear to
   continue`` and stops processing messages silently. We inject
   ``/compact`` to compress the conversation into a summary and resume,
   rate-limited to once every 10 minutes to avoid loops.
4. **Stuck interactive select widget** (``AskUserQuestion`` /
   ``ExitPlanMode``). A gateway session has no keyboard, so an
   interactive select TUI can never receive input and hangs forever.
   The PreToolUse hook (``metasphere.cli.pretool``) normally denies
   those tools *before* they render, so this is a **defense-in-depth
   backstop** for the cases that slip past it: the hook silently
   un-wired (e.g. an ``update.py`` hooks-block drift deletes it) or a
   *new* interactive tool the hook's matcher doesn't yet know. After a
   widget sits **untouched** (byte-stable) for the linger threshold we
   send a single ``Escape`` to cancel it (never ``Escape Escape`` —
   that opens the Rewind menu) and nudge the agent to its async idiom.

All checks are pure functions of capture-pane output + filesystem
state. ``run_watchdog`` composes them.
