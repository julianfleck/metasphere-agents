Wired into claude-code as the UserPromptSubmit hook. In addition to

the context build crashed. Reads session_id and transcript_path from

Usage: metasphere hooks context

UserPromptSubmit hook entrypoint. Wired into Claude Code via the
~/.metasphere/.claude/settings.local.json hooks block. Not invoked
directly by humans except for debugging.

Reads a JSON hook payload (session_id, transcript_path) from stdin
and writes a per-turn success breadcrumb so the Stop posthook can
fail-closed when context construction crashes.

Output: the rendered per-turn context block on stdout, exit code 0.
