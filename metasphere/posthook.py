Two responsibilities:

1. **Route** the final assistant text of a turn to Telegram for the
   ``@orchestrator`` agent only. Sub-agents communicate via the messages

2. **Track** turn completion: bump per-agent activity counter, update

The hook **must never raise**. Any exception is logged and swallowed; the
