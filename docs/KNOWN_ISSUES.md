## Critical (breaks core flow)

- [x] **`messages` script aborts silently when unread count is 0** — context hook prints `Error loading messages`.
      Where: `scripts/messages:171` — `((unread++))` returns exit 1 on first increment from 0, trips `set -e`.
      Fix: replaced with `unread=$((unread + 1))` (a6809ac+).
      Notes: classic bash gotcha. Audit complete (@explorer 2026-04-07): only other offender was `scripts/metasphere-agent` (9 sites in `doctor` + `tree` subtree-stats), all converted to `var=$((var + 1))`. No other `((var++))`/`((var--))`/`let` increments under `set -e` in scripts/.

## High

- [x] **Fractal spawning auto-exec missing** — `metasphere-spawn` now launches child detached via `nohup claude -p ... --dangerously-skip-permissions`, writes `pid` and `output.log` in agent dir, opt-out via `METASPHERE_SPAWN_NO_EXEC=1`. (Fixed in this session.)
      Related task: `fractal-spawning-any-agent-can-spawn-sub-agents-20260406`

- [ ] **Persistent agent idle GC** — `metasphere-wake` correctly reuses an existing tmux session if already alive (re-injects the task), but there is no upper bound on how long an idle session lives. After @polymarket completed its trading-run task at 15:18, the session sat idle. Next quick-scan at 15:30 will reuse it, which is correct, but a long-dormant agent (e.g. @briefing fires at 10:00 then nothing until tomorrow 10:00) would consume a tmux pane + claude process for 24h doing nothing. Need an idle timer (e.g. close session after N hours of no activity).
      Where: `scripts/metasphere-wake` + a periodic GC sweep
      Decision needed: should agents keep their session warm (better context, faster fires) or cold-start every time (cheaper, no GC needed)?

- [ ] **Spawned child in `-p` mode doesn't engage tools** — child process runs and exits cleanly but only prints "Done." with no tool calls. The harness markdown as the entire `-p` prompt is too descriptive / not action-imperative enough. Headless claude treats it as a doc, not a task.
      Where: `scripts/metasphere-spawn` harness template + invocation strategy
      Repro: spawn @smoke-test with a "send message back" task — process exits 0, status updates, but no message sent back.
      Hypotheses: (a) need to append an explicit "BEGIN. Execute the task now using bash." imperative at the end of the harness, (b) headless mode may need `--allowedTools "Bash,Read,Write,Edit"` explicitly, (c) the SPIRAL/Communication sections describe machinery without saying "do this now".
      Next: try option (a) + (b) together.

- [x] **Telegram send wrapper chokes on markdown chars** — `send_message()` defaulted to `parse_mode=Markdown` and used `-d "text=$text"` (no urlencode). Fixed: default parse_mode is now empty (plain text), always uses `--data-urlencode`. Markdown is opt-in via the third arg. (Fixed this session.)

- [x] **`~/.metasphere/bin/` was copies, not symlinks** — install.sh `cp`s scripts into bin, so any repo edit silently failed to take effect until reinstall. This invalidated all prior fixes in this session until the symlink conversion. Fixed: converted all 22 scripts in `~/.metasphere/bin/` to symlinks pointing at `$REPO/scripts/$name`. Backup at `~/.metasphere/bin.backup-20260407/`. install.sh should be updated to symlink by default.
      Follow-up: patch `install.sh` to use `ln -sf` instead of `cp` for the bin install step.

- [ ] **Telegram slash commands still point at openclaw** — `/inbox`, `/tasks`, `/schedule`, `/help` haven't been re-registered with BotFather for metasphere.

- [ ] **Tasks not properly cleaned up** — completed/stale tasks linger in `.tasks/active/`.
      Where: `scripts/tasks` (move-on-done logic missing or broken?)
      Repro: 1 found by @explorer 2026-04-07: `@ux-tester/ux-tester-lifecycle` was status:completed but lived in `.tasks/active/completed/ux-tester-lifecycle.md` (manually moved to `.tasks/completed/`). Suggests `tasks done` did move it but resolved the destination relative to `.tasks/active/` instead of `.tasks/`. Worth a one-line fix in scripts/tasks before the Python rewrite lands so live data stays clean.
      Also found: 5 active tasks with `/` in their id (e.g. `installsh-detect-.../metasphere-files-...`) created nested subdirs in `.tasks/active/`. Same root cause as `fix-tasks-slug-sanitization-for-slash-chars-20260406`.
      Related task: `audit-agent-ephemerality--cleanup-20260406`

## Normal

- [ ] **Memory maintenance not encoded in CLAUDE.md** — there's no explicit protocol telling the orchestrator when to prune `LEARNINGS.md`, rotate `HEARTBEAT.md`, summarize old daily logs, etc. The persona-index is lazy-loaded but the maintenance loop isn't documented.
      Where: `CLAUDE.md`, `~/.metasphere/agents/@orchestrator/`
      Notes: needs a "Memory Hygiene" section near Completion Protocol.

- [ ] **Daemon status accuracy** — `metasphere status` reports stale/wrong session state.
      Related task: `fix-metasphere-daemon-status-accuracy-20260406`

- [ ] **Task slug sanitization** — slashes in titles produce broken slugs/paths.
      Related task: `fix-tasks-slug-sanitization-for-slash-chars-20260406`

## Low

- [ ] **Agent tree doesn't look like a tree** — `metasphere agents` flat list, no hierarchy.
      Related task: `make-agent-tree-actually-look-like-a-tree-20260406`

- [ ] **Stale agents in registry** — `~/.metasphere/agents/` contains agents from old sessions (`@coding-integration`, `@coding-simple`, `@main`, `@night`, `@research-gather`, `@research-synthesize`, `@smoke-test`) with no GC.
